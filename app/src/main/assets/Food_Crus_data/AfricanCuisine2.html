                    <p class="">
                        Starter Method<br>
                        Combine corn flour , barley flour , sugar yeast and water , mix and let it rise for about an hour.<br>

                        In Large bowl combine flour , salt, baking powder and sugar<br>

                        Add the starter mixture to the flour, thoroughly mix and start adding water a little at a time until water has been completely used up, thoroughly miss to eliminate any lumps. You may use the blender to aid in the process.<br>
                        Let it rise for about 2 hours<br>


                        Quick Method<br>
                        In a large bowl combine all the ingredients, then start by adding a cup of water at a time to prevent lumps, then mix with hands preferably.<br>

                        Continue adding water, one cup at a time water until the water is completely used up.<br>


                        Blender Method<br>
                        Add water followed by the rest of the ingredients pulse until ingredients are fully blended<br>

                        Remove place in a large bowl and loosely cover with kitchen, let it rise for about 2 hours until bubbles form.<br>
                        Heat up a skillet, crepe pan, or non-stick fry pan preferably one with a matching lid.<br>

                        Heat the skillet on medium high heat, and then when ready to cook pour a ladleful (about ¾ cup or more) of the injera batter on to the pan spread from the center in a circular motion.<br>
                        About the size of a dinner plate. You may cover if you have a matching lid, covering shortens the cook time otherwise let it cook until all batter forms little brown spots coming through. No need to turn the batter.<br>
                        Transfer to a plate with a spatula or plate, put aside and continue cooking until the batter is finished<br>


                        Recipe Notes<br>
                        Is preferable to make injera by hand, so you get a feel of the batter. Start by adding a cup of water at a time to make a smooth batter.<br>

                        Traditionally this injera is  made with sorghum flour. However, you may substitute the sorghum flour with whole wheat flour. Barley flour  works as well.<br>

                        Keep in mind that humidity, flour and water do play a role in making this injera. Injera should be thicker than a crêpe, but not as thick as a traditional American pancake.<br>

                        You may replace the flour , salt and baking  powder with the same amount of self rising flour as it’s customary.<br>
